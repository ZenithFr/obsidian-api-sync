## 2024-03-24 - Implicit Labeling vs Explicit Association in Tailwind UI
**Learning:** Jinja templates combining form elements heavily styled with Tailwind utility classes often lack explicit `id` and `for` associations because visual placement replaces semantic grouping. This breaks screen-reader accessibility for visually-coupled elements.
**Action:** Always scan `.html` files for `<label>` tags with text but missing `for` attributes and manually bind them to the matching `id` of their input siblings to restore native accessibility.
